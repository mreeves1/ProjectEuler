/**
 * Project Euler - Problem 51
 *
 * Prime digit replacements
 *
 * By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number ?3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
 *
 * By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56??3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.
 *
 * Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.
