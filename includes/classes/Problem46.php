/**
 * Project Euler - Problem 46
 *
 * Goldbach's other conjecture
 *
 * It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
 * 9 = 7 + 2×12
 * 15 = 7 + 2×22
 * 21 = 3 + 2×32
 * 25 = 7 + 2×32
 * 27 = 19 + 2×22
 * 33 = 31 + 2×12
 *
 * It turns out that the conjecture was false.
 * What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
